# GitHub Pages Setup Guide

## Enable Interactive HTML Demos for Your Projects

Each of your projects now includes a beautiful, interactive HTML page that showcases results for non-technical audiences. Here's how to host them on GitHub Pages.

## What is GitHub Pages?

GitHub Pages is a free hosting service that turns HTML files in your repository into live websites. Perfect for:
- Portfolio demonstrations
- Non-technical presentations
- Stakeholder reports
- Interactive dashboards

## Customization Tips

### Change Colors
Edit the CSS in each `index.html` file:
```css
/* Find this section in <style> tags */
background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);
```

### Update Data
The charts use JavaScript at the bottom of each HTML file. Update the data arrays to show your actual results.

### Add More Charts
Use Plotly documentation: https://plotly.com/javascript/

## Troubleshooting

**Page not loading?**
- Check that `index.html` is in the correct folder
- Verify GitHub Pages is enabled in Settings
- Wait a few minutes after enabling

**Charts not showing?**
- Make sure you have internet connection (Plotly loads from CDN)
- Check browser console for errors (F12)

**Mobile issues?**
- All pages are responsive, but test on actual devices
- Adjust CSS media queries if needed
